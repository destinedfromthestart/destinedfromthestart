## 🚀 current project
### **Pride — Rapid Intervention Detection Enforcement**
> not just detection. *prevention in real-time.*

pluto aims to **detect & stop cheaters instantly**, using unique methods so detection vectors can’t be leaked.
it also bans hardware serials that cannot be spoofed from the os level, requiring hypervisors to simply spoof hardware.

⚡ **goal**: surpass eac.  
📌 **status**: very early development.
