## destinedfromthestart

i've quit developing cheats permanently unless they are eventually or a good cause if thats even possible -
i am currently working on my own kernel anti-cheat called Pluto Rapid Intervention Detection Enforcement.

as the name suggests, this doesnt just detect, but prevents cheaters in realtime.
this will be done in unique ways to stop people from finding our detection vectors.

it will 100% surpass battleye, but is in high early development.
